In this analysis, we delve into a dataset containing information on energy consumption along with various environmental and operational factors such as temperature, humidity, occupancy, and usage of HVAC and lighting systems. Our objective is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into energy consumption patterns and subsequently develop predictive models to forecast future energy usage.\n","\n","The dataset provides a comprehensive view of energy consumption dynamics over time, allowing us to explore how different factors influence energy demand. By examining the relationships between energy consumption and environmental variables like temperature and humidity, as well as operational factors such as occupancy and usage of HVAC and lighting systems, we aim to identify key drivers of energy consumption and understand their impact.\n","\n","Through EDA, we will visualize the distribution of variables, investigate correlations between features and energy consumption, analyze temporal trends, and explore patterns across different categorical variables such as day of the week and holidays. These insights will guide the development of predictive models capable of forecasting energy consumption accurately.\n","\n","By leveraging regression models, time series forecasting techniques, and ensemble methods, we aim to build robust models that can effectively predict future energy usage based on historical data and contextual factors. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be used to assess the performance of the models and ensure their reliability.\n","\n","Ultimately, the findings from this analysis can inform decision-making processes related to energy management, enabling stakeholders to optimize resource allocation, improve energy efficiency, and make informed decisions towards sustainability goals.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"192afe39","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-17T16:00:26.826389Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-17T16:00:26.825871Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-17T16:00:26.873805Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-17T16:00:26.872737Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.054895,"end_time":"2024-03-17T16:00:26.876474","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-17T16:00:26.821579","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style
